        <h2>📜 About me</h2>
        <p>
          I like to program in my free time, I like to read, and more than anything I want to become the best programmer ever. I also have a dream of traveling to space and seeing all the different planets in our solar system! I am currently attending Ohlone college with hopes of transferring to my dream school UC Berkeley. My intended major is Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I hope to one day have my own successful startup which transforms humanity!

        <p>
        I mostly have school projects under my belt one of which was working with reading data from text files and using it to answer given problems. I have also worked and contributed to build an autonomous RC car in my IEEE programming club at college.

        <p>
         One of my valuable accomplishments is that I have a 4.0 in college. I have also been given an award from my workplace Nordstrom for being an ever changing and always willing to learn employee.

        <h2>🌮 Work History</h2>

        <h3>Nordstrom</h3>
        <p>
          I was a warehouse associate and worked to replenish inventory. I also worked to transport boxes that consisted of customer orders as fast as I could to pickers who then helped those get to the packers. I also worked as a runner in which I placed shipped customer orders inside different trailers such as FedEx and ups. I also worked during my school year and did not let my work get in the way of my education.
